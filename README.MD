The script was written for simple interaction with the cloudstack api.
At the moment it has a limited action set, but will expand in the future if needed.

API information: https://cloudstack.apache.org/api/apidocs-4.7/TOC_User.html

## Setup ##
Copy/rename params.example to params.py and have the apikey and secretkey from the cloudstack interface added. Include the api endpoint, and one should be good to go.

## Usage ##
python cloudstack.py -h

## Current support ##

More information to be added :D
